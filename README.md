# Vehicle Spawner using Scaleform
This is a vehicle spawner menu made under Scaleform, the native GUI for GTA V, based on Flash, which makes up nearly all of the displays used in the game. This menu works similar to vehicle websites in GTA Online, like Legendary Motorsport,**note that this is not a modification of an existing Scaleform but a brand new custom one made entirely from scratch ðŸ‘Œ!**

I made this mostly as an exercise to mimic the games' UI functionalities, however there's still a lot to delve into.

I've made this to work on RAGE MP, but the Scaleform can work in other GTA V modifications (FiveM, ScriptHookV.NET, etc...) just like any other Scaleform inside the game.

This project features:
- Built-in cursor with supported mouse inputs and scroll.
- Multiple pages.
- Selectable buttons.
- Improved Scaleform code to handle return variables.
- Image import from .ytd files.
