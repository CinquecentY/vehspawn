# Vehicle Spawner using Scaleform
This vehicle spawner works entirely on GTA V's Scaleform using Flash Professional CS6, this project was made as an excercise and a showcase of the many things that can be done with Scaleform to reproduce the same UI compenents present in the base game.

This project features:
- Built-in cursor with supported mouse inputs.
- Selectionable buttons.
- Scaleform return/push functions
